Still some mathematics will be required to fully understand concepts as well as calculate useful information. To that end we will review some basic mathematics involving the most important and useful mathematical concepts and techniques. By far, the most common mathematics you will use in this course will be solving equations. We will review rewriting and solving algebraic equations for certain variables using standard multiplication, division, addition and subtraction. We will then move on to manipulating and solving polynomial equations, review techniques using logarithms and exponents, review basic and useful trigonometry and then how to solve systems of equations. As we will be studying the physics of chemistry in this textbook it is important for us to have use of basic analysis tools. We will review basic calculus focusing on single variable derivatives and integrals while introducing the concept of partial derivatives. This chapter is not meant as a complete and exhaustive review of all the Mathematics you have taken to this point. Rather it is hopefully a quick and helpful reminder of mathematics you have learned in the past. It is important to review even some basic algebraic operations because even strong students can sometimes subtract when they mean to divide or forget to distribute mathematical operations to all the terms in the equation. However, if you find there are certain topics you are still struggling with even after this review, it is vital that you address those early as this book moves very quickly through topics.","type":"content","url":"/book-content/section-01/chapter-a/chapter-a#chapter-a-mathematics-review","position":3},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter A.

Often when both types of processes must be done to solve an equation some confusion can occur. There are several helpful things to considered when dealing with situations like this. The first is when adding/subtracting elements you must ensure they have the same denominator. For example, you can’t add \\frac{2a}{x} and 3a directly because the respective denominators of x and 1 do not match. The second thing is that when multiply/dividing you must apply this process to each term. For example, if my equation is a + b + c = 2x and I divide both sides by x the result will be \\frac{a + b + c}{x}=\\frac{a}{x} + \\frac{b}{x} + \\frac{c}{x} = 2.

Mathematics Review","lvl3":"Polynomials","lvl2":"Solving With Multiplication and Division"},"content":"In physical sciences, we often use polynomials as a versatile mathematical tool to model and understand physical behavior and experiment. A polynomial is defined as an expression that consists of sums of variables raised to non-negative integer powers and multiplied by coefficients that can be positive or negatively signed. The general form of a polynomial is described in equation \n\n(A.4) where x is our variable, n is the degree of the polynomial. It’s the highest exponent of x and must be a non-negative integer. Each a term like a_n is a coefficient. Coefficients are just constant numbers that multiply its corresponding variable term. These can be positive, negative, or zero. You can think of it as a scaling factor that determines the magnitude and sign of its associated x power. Notice that for the final term x^0=1 so it just becomes a constant a_0.y = a_n x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1}\\cdots a_2 x^2 + a_1 x^1 + a_0 x^0\n\nHere are some examples of polynomials you may have already encountered or will encounter in this text.\n\ny = mx + b is the equation for a line.\n\ny = ax^2 + bx + c is the equation for a parabola.\n\nV^3 - \\left ( b + \\frac{RT}{P}\\right)V^2 + \\frac{a}{P}V -\\frac{ab}{P} = 0 is the van der Waals equation.\n\nWe use them for three primary reasons. First, you have likely done a ``line of best fit’’ on some data in your laboratory or class. Behind the scenes, the computer program is doing a linear regression on a polynomial of degree one (y = a_1x + a_0), we can fit polynomials of even higher degrees in the same way to experimental data points to create a mathematical model of the system we’re studying. Second, polynomials are incredibly easy to work with because their derivatives and integrals can be found using the simple power rule you learned in calculus, making calculations straightforward. Finally, and most powerfully, many complex functions that describe real-world phenomena, such as the potential energy of a chemical bond, can be accurately approximated by a polynomial via a Taylor series expansion. While we will not do this explicitly, you will however see what the expansion is and how it works. This allows us to simplify complicated problems into a manageable form without losing essential physical insight.\n\nRecall that we on occasion must find the roots of an equation. That is where the equation is equal to zero. When solving quadratic equations, polynomials of n = 2, you have probably learned how to factor the equation into the product of two linear parts. For example,\\begin{align}\nx^2 + 3x + 2 = 0\\\\\n\\left(x+1\\right)\\left(x+2\\right) = 0\\\\\n\\end{align}\n\nand so the solution is x = -1,x = -2.\n\nOr for more challenging problems you might have learned how to complete the square or use the quadratic formula (equation \n\n(A.5)).x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\nIn this class we will encounter higher order polynomials. There are methods for solving these, however, we will not learn how to do them explicitly. Rather we will use computational tools like Mathematica or Python.","type":"content","url":"/book-content/section-01/chapter-a/chapter-a#polynomials","position":13},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter A.

To solve this we must manipulate the equation to get pressure (P) and volume (V) on separate sides of the equation. Because we are looking at how pressure is changing with volume we will want to have pressure on the left-hand side, abbreviated LHS, and then have volume on the right-hand side, abbreviated RHS. This will be done by dividing\nOne thing we will note which we manipulate an equation to put one variable on the LHS and one variable on the RHS is we are creating a function. Plainly speaking, a function is a little mathematical machine that takes an input, what we call the independent variable, and spits out another variable, what we call the dependent variable. Sometimes functions will be clearly spelled out. For example, we will see when we get to wave-functions where we declare them as \\psi\\left ( x \\right). In this case \\psi is the dependent variable and is a function of x which is the independent variable. Sometimes, the relationship, dependent and independent variables, is not explicitly stated, and we must make that inference. This is the case for our ideal gas law example above. For that example, we could say that the pressure is a function of the volume. Stated more directly P\\left(V\\right) = \\frac{nRT}{V}.

It is vital you be able to confidently change units, and especially derived units, accurately. The key to making the conversions is to pay attention to whether the unit is in the numerator or denominator. Most errors come from converting with inverted relationships. Key to doing this correctly is writing out ALL units and not taking shortcuts. Let’s show a couple of examples.\n\nwe will start with a straight forward one where we will convert 1.23\\:m to kilometers,\\begin{align}\n1.23\\:m =\\:?\\:km\\\\\n\\text{Use the fact that}\\: 1000\\:m = 1\\:km\\\\\n1.23\\:m\\times \\frac{1\\:km}{1000\\:m}\\\\\n1.23\\:\\cancel{m}\\times \\frac{1\\:km}{1000\\:\\cancel{m}}\\\\\n\\frac{1.23\\:km}{1000}=0.00123\\:km=\\boxed{1.23\\times 10^{-3}\\:km}\n\\end{align}\n\nWe can do a trickier one if we look at derived units and units with exponents. Let’s next convert 4.56\\:kg\\:L^{-1} to units of grams per cubic meter (g\\:m^{-3}). To do this let’s first write out some of the conversion ratios that might be helpful. 1\\:kg = 1000\\:g, 1\\:L = 1\\:dm^3, and 1\\:dm = 0.1\\:m.\n\nClick here for solution\\begin{align}\n\\frac{4.56\\:\\cancel{kg}}{1\\:L}\\times\\frac{1000\\:g}{1\\:\\cancel{kg}}=\\frac{4.56\\times10^3\\:g}{1\\:L}\\\\\n\\frac{4.56\\times10^3\\:g}{1\\:\\cancel{L}}\\times\\frac{1\\:\\cancel{L}}{1\\:dm^3}=\\frac{4.56\\times10^3\\:g}{1\\:dm^3}\\\\\n\\frac{4.56\\times10^3\\:g}{1\\:dm^3}\\times\\left(\\frac{0.1\\:dm}{1\\:m}\\right)^3=\\frac{4.56\\times10^3\\:g}{1\\:\\cancel{dm^3}}\\times\\frac{0.001\\:\\cancel{dm^3}}{1\\:m^3}=\\frac{4.56\\:g}{1\\:m^3}\\\\\n\\boxed{4.56\\:g\\:m^{-3}}\n\\end{align}\n\nLastly let’s look at using and converting to non-SI units (typically imperial units). You may see some familiar or unfamiliar unit comparisons that may be necessary. For example, there are 2.54\\:cm per 1\\:in. There are also 12\\:inch per 1\\:ft and 5280\\:ft per 1\\:mi.

These have been a very successful model and are good at explaining many physical phenomena. We will find later in this text that for some problems we will require the use of a new type of theory (Spoiler Quantum Theory). We will review Newton’s laws but I will also give for you some information about why these laws are important for you to internalize and how they come up in every chemical system one way or another.\n\nNewton’s Three Laws\n\nThe first law is the law of inertia. An object will remain at rest or in uniform, straight-line motion unless acted upon by and external force.\n\nIn general chemistry we learn about the Kinetic Molecular Theory of Gases (KMT), which models gas particles traveling in straight lines until they encounter either the wall or another gas particle.\n\nWe will also find that additional and small attractive forces of real gases will require us to modify the ideal gas law due to the change in momentum of the gas particles.\n\nThe second law is the law that defines the force. The force (F) acting on an object is equal to its mass (m) times its acceleration (a). You can think of it also being the rate of change of the momentum (p) also (and in some ways maybe more fundamental).\n\nF = ma and F = \\frac{dp}{dt}\n\nWhen looking at the origin of pressure what we are finding is the force exerted by the gas particle as it collides with the wall.\n\nAnother way we can determine the force is by analyzing the potential energy. Interestingly the force of the system is related to how the potential changes with distance and is defined as V\\left(r\\right) = -\\frac{d V\\left(r\\right)}{dr}.\n\nA very relevant example for studying chemistry is that the behavior of bonded atoms for small displacements will mimic the behavior of two masses connected by a spring.\n\nThe third law is the action-reaction law. For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.\n\nAgain with two collisions of gas molecules we will conserve the momentum in the closed system (and energy if it is an elastic collision) due to the equal and opposite forces.","type":"content","url":"/book-content/section-01/chapter-b/chapter-b#newtons-laws","position":23},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter B.

Rather than focusing on involved derivations and mathematics, this book is focused on covering a wider range of applicable topics and focuses more on creating an ``intuitive’’ sense of physical chemistry. Also, because many students require an understanding of basic physical chemistry for biochemistry and biology many of the examples, problems and topics will have a biological and biochemical theme. It is hoped that this text will offer a good introduction to basic physical chemical principles for biochemists. What this book is not intended to do is be an in-depth, mathematical and rigorous study of physical chemistry. While, this text could be a great introduction to topics it is not an adequate study for those students wanting to study chemistry, especially physical, at a graduate level. Rather it would be appropriate for students wanting to pursue laboratory careers, health fields and biochemistry.\n\nThe structure of this book is also one of self-inquiry. The idea, is that concepts will be laid out as the student reads each section. There are questions to answer along the way that will help to keep the student engaged. Additionally, there are also separate quizzes in Canvas that will test what the students have been reading and keep them on track. At the end of each chapter there will also be example and practice problems for the students to d on their own to help them practice topics. The practice problems are few, but typically range from easy to challenging. Being able to complete all the problems, without guidance, should indicate reasonable understanding and result in good exam scores.","type":"content","url":"/book-content/section-01/preface","position":1},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 1: History of Quantum Mechanics"},"type":"lvl1","url":"/book-content/section-02/chapter-01/chapter-01","position":0},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 1: History of Quantum Mechanics"},"content":"import sys\nimport os\n\n# This block MUST be at the top of your file.\n# It finds the project root and adds it to the Python path.\n# Adjust the number of \"..\" to match how many folders deep your file is.\ntry:\n    cwd = os.getcwd()\n    # e.g., use (\"..\", \"..\") for a file 2 levels deep.\n    project_root = os.path.abspath(os.path.join(cwd, \"..\", \"..\", \"..\"))\n    if project_root not in sys.path:\n        sys.path.insert(0, project_root)\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f\"Error setting project path: {e}\")\n\n","type":"content","url":"/book-content/section-02/chapter-01/chapter-01","position":1},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 1: History of Quantum Mechanics"},"type":"lvl1","url":"/book-content/section-02/chapter-01/chapter-01#chapter-1-history-of-quantum-mechanics","position":2},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 1: History of Quantum Mechanics"},"content":"We will begin by looking at the origins of quantum mechanics.

This will not be our only discussion of this topic but it is important that we have some of the basics down before moving forward. The first is that light is an electro-magnetic wave. From the diagram (INCLUDE DIAGRAM), we see that it is an alternating electric wave in one dimension and then an alternating magnetic wave in a perpendicular plane. Because it is a wave we can define it based on the length of the wave. The length of the wave (measured from crest to crest) is called \\lambda, pronounced lambda. We also know from other experiments that we won’t discuss in this text that light all travels at the same speed in a vacuum. That is the speed of light, called c, and is approximately 300,000\\:km\\:s^{-1}. So we know wavelengths of the light but we also know the speed. That means we can determine another property of light. Consider a wave is moving by you and you are at a certain point in space. You could see the rise and fall of the crest of the wave as it moves. You could see how many times the wave rises and falls in a given amount of time. Let’s say per second. Given that all light, regardless of wavelength, moves at the same speed we can now find the frequency of the light.

In fact, other laws had proposed that the force was rather proportional to the velocity rather than acceleration. We of course have found that momentum is true for this case. Schrödinger proposed his equation in much the same matter. There are two forms of Schrödinger equation we will discuss but only one that we will use in any meaningful sense. The first is called the Time Dependent Schrödinger Equation that we will refer to from now on as TDSE and can be seen in equation \n\n(2.2). The second and more useful form of this equation that we will use is called the Time Independent Schrödinger Equation that will be referred to as TISE and can be seen in equation \n\n(2.4).i\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}\\Psi\\left(x,t\\right) = \\hat{H}\\Psi\\left(x,t\\right)\n\n\\hat{H} is known as the Hamiltonian operator. We will talk about operators later but suffice to say it is something that tells us about the energy of our system. The Hamiltonian is divided into two parts, the kinetic energy, -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2}, and the potential energy V\\left(x,t\\right). Together they combine to become the Hamiltonian, \\hat{H}, defined in one-dimension in equation \n\n(2.3). \\Psi \\left(x,t\\right) and \\Psi \\left(x\\right)$ are what is known as the wavefunction. The wavefunction is a very important part as it encapsulates all possible information about a quantum system. The wavefunction is also a purely mathematical object. What that means is that the wavefunction itself is not directly observable or experimentally measured. We will discuss how the wavefunction is physically relevant and measurable in section \n\nOperators and Expectation Values.-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\frac{\\partial^2}{\\partial x^2} + V\\left(x,t\\right)\\hat{H}\\Psi\\left(x\\right) = E\\Psi\\left(x\\right)\n\nWe will almost exclusively be looking at TISE because the systems we are going to be looking at are stable over reasonably long time frames. There are places where the TDSE is important becuase the system changes with time. For example, looking at things like photon absorption probabilities, processes like fluoresce and some kinetics questions about things like bond formation all require seeing how the wave function changes with time.","type":"content","url":"/book-content/section-02/chapter-02/chapter-02#schr-dingers-equation","position":17},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 2: Foundations of Quantum Mechanics","lvl2":"Particle in a Box"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/book-content/section-02/chapter-02/chapter-02#particle-in-a-box","position":18},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 2: Foundations of Quantum Mechanics","lvl2":"Particle in a Box"},"content":"The model we use to play understand behavior and consequences of quantum systems and specifically Schrödinger’s equation is the Particle in a Box (PIB). It is important to note that the PIB problem is a good starting place, however, there are aspects of it that are idealized. We will be able to apply it to some real systems but in order to have it match correctly will require work beyond the scope of this course.\n\nHere is the system. We will have a particle, we could use an electron, and we are going to confine it to live in a box. What does it mean to live in a box? What we are going to do is create a potential energy in which the boundaries of the box are infinite energy (not realistic but a good first approximation) and the inside of the box has no energy. So it is inside a square potential and therefore a particle.\n\nOk so now we have an electron in a little energy well. Where does the quantum mechanics come in? Well do understand how the electron behaves we must use Schrödinger’s equation.\n\nOur particle must behave according to the rules of the Schrödinger’s equation as well as the boundary conditions that define our system. For our example, those rules are that the electron is NOT allowed to ever be outside the box. How do we say that mathematically? We will define our wavefunction, \\psi, in such a way that it will be equal to zero when the position of the electron, defined by x is not within the boundary of the box.\n\nSo what about when the electron is in the box? When 0\\ge x \\le L we will use equation \n\n(2.4) and equation \n\n(2.3) where, $V \\left (x,t\\right) = 0. If we write this out we get equation \n\n(2.5)-\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}\\frac{d^2\\psi \\left(x\\right)}{d x^2} = E\\psi\\left(x\\right)\n\nWe will not solve this problem explicit, however, you can find solutions to this equation in any physical chemistry text. Rather let’s look for clues about what the solution should look like. Equation \n\n(2.5) is a second order differential equation. With differential equations rather than solving for a value like you have in the past you solve it for an entire function! So we want to determine what function of x, that we are calling \\psi will satisfy the equation. Well what does the equation say? It says that whatever function \\psi is we have to be able to take the second derivative of it with respect to x, multiply it by -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m}, and get a solution that looks like the original function, \\psi multiplied by an energy term. Well what kind of functions can you take second derivatives of and get back out something that resembles the original function? If we go back to section \n\nDerivatives we will see that there are two possibilities. The first is an exponential. Recall that \\frac{d^2 e^{ax}}{dx^2} = a^2e^{ax}. The other possibility would be \\sin x and \\cos x. Recall that \\frac{d^2\\sin x}{dx^2}= -\\sin x and \\frac{d^2\\cos x}{dx^2}= -\\cos x. So which solution makes the most sense? Let’s look at other information in the problem. Recall, the boundary conditions earlier required that the wavefunction be zero at the wall of the box (0 and L). We cannot make the exponential function zero at any point, so that will be out. Both the \\sin and \\cos functions can be zero at certain points. Here is where our choice of coordinates matters. When x = 0 we know that \\psi(x) = 0, so which of the two trig functions satisfies these criteria? The answer is \\sin as \\cos\\left(0\\right)= 1. So we know that the function’s general formula will look like \\sin\\left(x\\right) but we don’t know any details. Here we require the other boundary condition. In this case that boundary condition is that the When x = L,that is also \\psi(x) = 0. Here is where we will start to see where quantum mechanics solutions look different from the classical analog. If we want to solve for this problem we can set it up in equation \n\n(2.6).\\sin\\left(ax\\right) = 0\n\nRecall, from the section on \n\nTrigonometric Functions and Identities that \\sin\\left(\\theta\\right) = 0 when \\theta = 0,\\:\\pi,\\:2\\pi,\\:3\\pi,\\:4\\pi\\ldots, but also that the zero should come when n\\pi x = L to enforce the second boundary condition. Therefore, there are many but RESTRICTED solutions. If we solve \n\n(2.6) and the zero solutions for \\sin we get that \\psi\\left(x\\right) = N \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L} \\right). N is something called the normilzation constant and it is something we will determine in the next section.","type":"content","url":"/book-content/section-02/chapter-02/chapter-02#particle-in-a-box","position":19},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 2: Foundations of Quantum Mechanics","lvl2":"Probability Density"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/book-content/section-02/chapter-02/chapter-02#probability-density","position":20},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 2: Foundations of Quantum Mechanics","lvl2":"Probability Density"},"content":"Earlier in the chapter we discussed that the wavefunction has no physical meaning. That seems odd and frankly kind of stupid considering we are looking at the physical behavior of an electron stuck in a box. So how does one use the wavefunction? First we must realize that now that the electron is being represented by a wavefunctionn it will no longer behave like the little particle we put in the box. We should be comfortable with this considering that we know we can determine the wavelength for a free electron by the de Broglie equation \n\n(2.1). However, now we start to lose sense of some simple notions about our electron. For starters, where can we find the electron within the box? Since it has a wavelength and is behaving like a wave in some ways the question is silly. A Wave is not in a single spot.

For reasons beyond this course, we are going to look at the square of the magnitude of the wavefunction defined as \\left|\\psi\\right|^2. This gives us a distribution of where there is sort of more electron and where there is sort of less electron. Another way we can look at this is as a probability of finding the electron. If we were to look for the electron many times is that it would not always be in the same place but after a while we would find some places it was found more often than others and still other places, specifically the nodes, where we don’t find it at all.\n\nAn important aspect of the probability distribution is it must be normalized. What does that mean? It means that the probability of finding the particle anywhere must be 100\\% (wouldn’t make much sense otherwise.) So how do we ensure that this is true? We calculate a normalization factor, basically a number, that will ensure when we find the probability density by squaring the wavefunction, the entire probability will be 1.\n\nOk we said that with words how do we say that with mathematics? Well first let’s look at our current wavefunction.\\psi\\left(x\\right) = N \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L} \\right)\n\nWe will now take the square of the magnitude of \\psi,\\begin{align}\n\\left|\\psi\\left(x\\right)\\right|^2 = N \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L} \\right) N \\sin\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L} \\right)\\\\\n\\left|\\psi\\left(x\\right)\\right|^2 = N^2 \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L} \\right)\n\\end{align}\n\nSo how do we calculate N and make sure the probability is normalized? We stated above we want to make sure that the electron has to be somewhere all the time. That means the entire probability of being anywhere must add up to 100\\%. Ok then how do we do this mathematically? It is easy if you have discrete states. For example, on a fair dice each side has a probability of \\frac{1}{6} and their are 6 sides so if you add them all up you get a total probability that some number will be rolled of 1. How do we do this with the wave? What we do is imagine a very small section of the probability. We will call this very small section of the probability density that is dx wide. And then we will ``add’’ yup all these little sections. The mathematical tool we will use is called an integral.\\begin{align}\n\\int_{0}^{L}N^2 \\sin^2\\left(\\frac{n\\pi x}{L} \\right) dx = 1\\\\\n\\left.\\vphantom{\\int}N^2\\left(\\frac{1}{2}x - \\frac{L\\sin{\\frac{2 n \\pi x}{L}}}{2 n \\pi} \\right)\\right|_0^L = 1\\\\\nN^2\\left(\\frac{1}{2}L - \\frac{L\\sin{\\frac{2n\\pi L}{L}}}{2n\\pi}\\right)-N^2\\left(\\cancel{\\frac{1}{2}0} - \\cancel{\\frac{L\\sin{\\frac{2n\\pi 0}{L}}}{2n\\pi}}\\right)^2=1\\\\\nN^2\\left(\\frac{1}{2}L - \\frac{L\\cancel{\\sin{\\frac{2n\\pi L}{L}}}}{2n\\pi}\\right) = 1 \\\\\nN^2\\frac{1}{2}L = 1\\\\\nN = \\sqrt{\\frac{2}{L}}\n\\end{align}","type":"content","url":"/book-content/section-02/chapter-02/chapter-02#probability-density","position":21},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 2: Foundations of Quantum Mechanics","lvl2":"Operators and Expectation Values"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/book-content/section-02/chapter-02/chapter-02#operators-and-expectation-values","position":22},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 2: Foundations of Quantum Mechanics","lvl2":"Operators and Expectation Values"},"content":"","type":"content","url":"/book-content/section-02/chapter-02/chapter-02#operators-and-expectation-values","position":23},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 2: Foundations of Quantum Mechanics","lvl2":"Quantum Harmonic Oscillator"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/book-content/section-02/chapter-02/chapter-02#quantum-harmonic-oscillator","position":24},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 2: Foundations of Quantum Mechanics","lvl2":"Quantum Harmonic Oscillator"},"content":"If you imagine a spring with a mass on it, we can compress the spring and then let it go.

Recall we defined some basic principles of angular motion in the physics review chapter on \n\nMomentum . If we have a particle with mass m and it is constrained to move on a circular ring of radius r the magnitude of its angular momentum in the axis perpendicular to the ring (that we will call the z axis) is defined in equation \n\n(2.14), where p is the instantaneous linear momentum of the particle confined to the ring and is defined as p = mv.J_z = pr\n\nThe total energy of our system is due completely to the motion of the particle and so is kinetic in origin. We can express the energy of the system by relating the kinetic energy (equation \n\n(B.1)) to the angular momentum by using instantaneous linear momentum p (equation \n\n(B.5)) in equation \n\n(2.14).\\begin{align}\nE = \\frac{1}{2}mv^2 = \\frac{p^2}{2m}=\\frac{\\left(\\frac{J_z}{r}\\right)^2}{2m} = \\frac{J_z^2}{2mr^2}\n\\end{align}\n\nWe might notice that the bottom of the equation derived above looks like the moment of inertia defined in equation (\n\n(B.6)).

Explain why it is or isn't.\n\nUp to this point we have just been defining a classical system. So where does the quantum part come in? Well we know that particles can behave like waves so how could we define the wavelike character of our particle moving in a circle? We know from the de Broglie equation (\n\n(2.1)) that the wavelength is inversely proportional to the linear momentum (p = \\frac{h}{\\lambda}). We also know that the magnitude of the angluar momentum along the z axis is proportional to the instantaneous linear momentum. Combining these two concepts we can derive an expression for J_z in terms of the wavelength \\lambda.\\begin{align}\nJ_z = p r = \\frac{h r}{\\lambda}\n\\end{align}\n\nOne condition for the particle’s wavefunction to be physically realistic is that as it goes around in a circular path it must meet back up with itself exactly. Mathematically that is stated as it must be continuous and single-valued. If this condition is not satisfied, the resulting wave would destructively interfere and cancel itself out.\n\nThis requirement imposes a critical boundary condition that wavelength must be an integer multiple, that we will call m_l, of the circumference of the ring (2πr)\\begin{align}\nm_l\\lambda = 2 \\pi r\\\\\n\\lambda = \\frac{2\\pi r}{m_l}\\\\\n m_l= 0,\\pm 1,\\pm 2,\\pm3,\\ldots\\\\\n\\end{align}\n\nIf you notice we are not restricted to only positive integer values.

Here is a summary of what the quantum numbers do and what values are allowed.\n\nThe principal quantum number, n, can have values of n = 1,2,3,\\ldots. The primary physical meaning of this quantity is that it determines what the energy of the orbital will be. For hydrogen, orbitals with the same n value will have the same energy, or often said to be degenerate.\n\nThe angular momentum quantum number is l. The values that l can have is based on the principal quantum number n. The allowable states are l = 0,1,2,\\ldots,(n-1). The primary physical meaning of this are that it tells you the shape of the of orbital. Additionally, the l numbers have a letter designation that are given below. (see diagram for pictures of examples of the shapes of these orbitals)\n\nl = 0 \\rightarrow\\:\\text{s orbital}\n\nl = 1 \\rightarrow\\:\\text{p orbital}\n\nl = 2 \\rightarrow\\:\\text{d orbital}\n\nl = 3 \\rightarrow\\:\\text{f orbital}\n\nThe magnetic quantum number, m_l, defines the orientation of the orbital in three-dimensional space. The m_l values are determined by the respective angular quantum number, l. The allowable values are m_l = -l, -(l-1),\\ldots,-1,0,1,\\ldots,l-1,l. For example, if l = 2, then m_l = -2,-1,0,1,2.\n\nFinally, there is the spin quantum number m_s. This quantum number is only two valued and does not depend on the other quantum numbers. It can be m_s = \\frac{1}{2} or $m_s=-\\frac{1}{2}. It is an intrinsic angular momentum of the electron, separate from the angular momentum of the electron orbital around the nucleus this is why it is called spin.","type":"content","url":"/book-content/section-02/chapter-03/chapter-03#quantum-numbers","position":11},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 3: Atomic Systems","lvl2":"Multielectron Atoms"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/book-content/section-02/chapter-03/chapter-03#multielectron-atoms","position":12},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Chapter 3: Atomic Systems","lvl2":"Multielectron Atoms"},"content":"Recall from \n\nQuantum Numbers\n\nThere are several fundamental rules for multielectron atoms that inform us on how to identify electrons. The first is that no two electrons in the same atom may share all four quantum numbers with any other electron. This is known as the Pauli exclusion principle. Another rule is that all electrons will fill from the lowest energy and move up systematicaly. This is known as Aufbau. Last, when filling orbitals with degenerate states, electrons will enter singly and only after all degenerate orbitals have a single electron will they begin to pair up. This is known as Hund’s rule.\n\nConceptual question “A substance that is paramagnetic is attracted to magnetic fields, while a substance that is diamagnetic is repelled by magnetic fields.

For example, in something with four electron groups (bonds or lone pairs) around a central atom in a Lewis structure, for example water or methane (see image....) you would hybridize one 2s orbital with three 2p orbitals to make four sp^3 hybridized orbitals.
