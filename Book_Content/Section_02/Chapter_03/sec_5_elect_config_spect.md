## Electronic Configurations and Spectroscopy

To build an atom, we follow three core rules:
1.  **Pauli Exclusion Principle:** No two electrons can have the same four quantum numbers.
2.  **Aufbau Principle:** Fill from lowest energy to highest ($1s < 2s < 2p \dots$).
3.  **Hund's Rule:** Occupy degenerate orbitals singly before pairing.

These rules allow us to predict **Term Symbols**, which describe the total angular momentum of an atom. Understanding these states is the final step in motivating **Atomic Spectroscopy**, where we look at the specific allowable transitions between these multi-electron states.

**Conceptual question** "A substance that is paramagnetic is attracted to magnetic fields, while a substance that is diamagnetic is repelled by magnetic fields. How does this relate to paired and unpaired electrons?"
