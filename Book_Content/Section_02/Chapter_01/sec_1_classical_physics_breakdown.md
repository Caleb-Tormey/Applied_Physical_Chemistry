The photo electric effect was a phenomena where light was shown on a metal surface. Under certain conditions electrons would be ejected from the surface of the metal. Because electrons have mass and they were moving these electrons would have a certain amount of kinetic energy (recall based on equation {ref}`kinetic_energy`).
