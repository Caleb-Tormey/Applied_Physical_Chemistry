## Vectors
It isn't just enough to say something is moving at a certain rate, we must also talk about in what direction. Given a coordinate system we can define things like velocity and acceleration based on these principles. This is the point of a vector. It not only has a value it contains in it information about the direction it is going. 

The magnitude of the vector is given by the length of the vector. 


**You will notice the magnitude of the vector equation is similar to how we found distances between two points. How are they related?**
