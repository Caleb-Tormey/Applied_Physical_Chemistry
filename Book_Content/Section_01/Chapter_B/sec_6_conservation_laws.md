## Conservation Laws: The Universe's Accounting System

At the heart of both physics and chemistry lies a set of **Laws of Conservation**. These laws act as the fundamental accounting rules of the universe; they state that certain physical properties do not change over time within an isolated system. While energy or matter may change its **form** or **location**, the total "ledger" must always balance.

### Conservation of Mass
Historically defined by Antoine Lavoisier, the **Law of Conservation of Mass** states that mass is neither created nor destroyed during a chemical reaction. 

* **The Chemical View:** In any chemical equation, every atom present in the reactants must be accounted for in the products. Atoms are simply rearranged into new molecular structures; they do not vanish.
* **In Practice:** If you burn a log, the mass of the original wood and the oxygen consumed equals the exact mass of the resulting ash, carbon dioxide, and water vapor produced.



### Conservation of Energy
The **First Law of Thermodynamics** states that the total energy of an isolated system remains constant. As we explored in the [Energy Transformation](#energy-transformation-and-conservation) section, energy frequently shifts between different "buckets," but the total amount of energy in the universe is fixed.

* **The Shift:** Energy can move from **Kinetic** (motion) to **Potential** (stored) or to **Thermal** (heat). 
* **The Chemistry Link:** In an exothermic reaction, the chemical potential energy stored in molecular bonds is released as heat. The energy "lost" by the molecules is exactly equal to the energy "gained" by the surroundings.

### Conservation of Charge
In any process—from a high-energy particle collision to a simple battery powering a sensor—the total electric charge of an isolated system remains constant.

* **Subatomic Balance:** If a neutral atom loses an electron to become a positive ion, that electron must be transferred elsewhere, creating a negative ion or a current. 
* **Redox Reactions:** In chemistry, "Reduction-Oxidation" reactions are governed by this law. We track the movement of electrons to ensure that the charge lost by one species is identical to the charge gained by another.

### The Modern Synthesis: Mass-Energy Equivalence
While we treat mass and energy as separate for most of chemistry, modern physics (via $E=mc^2$) reveals that they are actually two sides of the same coin. In nuclear reactions, a tiny amount of mass can be converted into a massive amount of energy. However, for the systems we discuss in this chapter, we can safely treat the conservation of mass and the conservation of energy as two distinct, unbreakable rules.

### Summary Table: What is Conserved?

| Property | What stays the same? | Practical Application |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Mass** | The total number of atoms | Balancing chemical equations |
| **Energy** | Total Joules ($KE + PE + Q$) | Calorimetry and reaction enthalpy |
| **Charge** | Sum of protons and electrons | Electrochemistry and Redox |
| **Momentum** | The "Quantity of Motion" ($mv$) | Collision analysis and gas kinetics |
