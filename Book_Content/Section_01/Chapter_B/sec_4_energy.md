## Energy

We define energy as what is required to do work. Well now we need to know what work is. Work is applying a force over a distance. The most obvious example would be lifting an object. If you have an object on the ground

### Kinetic
This is the energy of motion. The most basic definition is 

:::{math}
:label: kinetic_energy
KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2

It can also be defined by the momentum ($p = m v$) in equation {ref}`kinetic_energy_momentum`
:::{math}
:label: kinetic_energy_momentum
KE = \frac{p^2}{2m}

### Potential

#### Electromagnetism

This topic is incredibly deep. We will however, just take a brief look at properties of electric charges and magnetic fields. The first is that like charges repel, and unalike charges attract. We can actually see this if we look at the governing potential energy equation known as Coulomb's law shown in equation {ref}`coulomb_pot`.

:::{math} 
:label: coulomb_pot
V\left(r\right) = \frac{q_1q_2}{4\pi\epsilon_0 r}

:label: coulomb_force
F\left(r\right) = \frac{q_1q_2}{4\pi\epsilon_0 r^2}
