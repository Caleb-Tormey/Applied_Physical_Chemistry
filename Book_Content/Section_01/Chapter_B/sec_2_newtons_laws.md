## Newton's Laws

For our review we will just worry about the basics of Newton's Laws. These have been a very successful model and are good at explaining many physical phenomena. We will find later in this text that for some problems we will require the use of a new type of theory (Spoiler Quantum Theory). We will review Newton's laws but I will also give for you some information about why these laws are important for you to internalize and how they come up in every chemical system one way or another. 

Newton's Three Laws
- The first law is the law of inertia. An object will remain at rest or in uniform, straight-line motion unless acted upon by and external force. 
    * In general chemistry we learn about the Kinetic Molecular Theory of Gases (KMT), which models gas particles traveling in straight lines until they encounter either the wall or another gas particle. 
    * We will also find that additional and small attractive forces of real gases will require us to modify the ideal gas law due to the change in momentum of the gas particles. 
- The second law is the law that defines the force. The force ($F$) acting on an object is equal to its mass ($m$) times its acceleration ($a$). You can think of it also being the rate of change of the momentum ($p$) also (and in some ways maybe more fundamental). 
    * $F = ma$ and $F = \frac{dp}{dt}$
    * When looking at the origin of pressure what we are finding is the force exerted by the gas particle as it collides with the wall. 
    * Another way we can determine the force is by analyzing the potential energy. Interestingly the force of the system is related to how the potential changes with distance and is defined as $V\left(r\right) = -\frac{d V\left(r\right)}{dr}$. 
    * A very relevant example for studying chemistry is that the behavior of bonded atoms for small displacements will mimic the behavior of two masses connected by a spring. 
- The third law is the action-reaction law. For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. 
    * Again with two collisions of gas molecules we will conserve the momentum in the closed system (and energy if it is an elastic collision) due to the equal and opposite forces.
