## Momentum
### Linear
We discussed this earlier where momentum is defined in equation {ref}`linear_momentum` 
:::{math}
:label: linear_momentum
p =mv
:::
### Angular

The moment of inertia $I$ plainly speaking is how difficult it is to start spinning something or how hard it is to slow/stop it from spinning. So a little object with not much mass is easy to stop whereas a large object with a big radius is more difficult. 

:::{math}
:label: moment_of_inertia
I = mr^2
:::

### Torque

Just as we need to apply a force to change linear momentum. We must apply a torque to change angular momentum. 

:::{note}
***Conceptual Question:*** In the moment of inertia question, does changing the mass or changing the radius have a greater impact on the moment of inertia? Explain your reasoning.
