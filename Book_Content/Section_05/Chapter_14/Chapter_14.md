# Chapter 14: Reaction Mechanisms and Catalysis

In Chapter 13, we treated the enzyme like a black box. We knew that the substrate went in, the product came out, and the mathematical speed limit of the process could be mapped using the Michaelis-Menten equation. But what is physically happening inside that box? 

To truly understand chemistry and biology, we have to look past the macroscopic rate laws and zoom into the microscopic, step-by-step molecular dance that occurs as bonds break and form. This is the study of **reaction mechanisms**.

## Practice Problems

You are free to do none, some or all these problems as you see fit. They would be very helpful to use in studying for the chapter exams.
